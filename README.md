User CSS Contributions For CustomizeMyBird and Custom CSS For FX

This repository is for user submitted CSS customizations for:
1.  The very excellent Firefox and Thunderbird add-ons by Aris-t2 at https://github.com/Aris-t2 ; and
2.  Other useful CSS contributions for Firefox and Thunderbird.

Note:  I prefer the older look of Windows XP/2000 over the Aero interface.  Therefore, I use the Classic Windows Theme on Win 7 as my starting point.  Then I add the "Classic Start Menu" available from http://www.classicshell.net/ .  Then for Firefox I use the "Classic Blue" theme from "ndnenigma" available for Firefox at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/5414873/ .  This theme is a dark theme for the toolbar, bookmarks toolbar, and menu bar areas.  As a result various standard color choices from add-ons don't work as well as I would like (colorwise).  Also, I like rounded tabs and spacing that is a little bit different from what the add-ons usually provide.

As a result I've had to modify some of the setup from Custom CSS For FX and CustomizeMyBird to get the look I find pleasing.

If you don't like the color choices in my CSS it can of course be easily modified.

Also, remember I am no programmer so let me apologize in advance if my CSS contains any deviations from best practices, etc.

If you want to further duplicate my color setup on Windows 7 then first select the Classic Windows Theme.  After that download the JYLD_Color_Choices.reg file to your computer and then double click it to add it to your registry.  You should save a copy of your current theme before doing this so you can go back to your original color choices.  Also note that my color choices work on Windows 7 and XP.  On Windows 7 you must be using the Windows Classic Theme for these color choices to have any effect.  After adding the color choices reg file settings to your registry you will have to reboot your computer for the changes to take effect.  

NOTE:  I have no idea how the color choices reg file would affect Windows 8 to 10, if at all.  I don't even know if the Windows Classic Theme is available on Windows 8 to 10.
