User CSS Contributions For CustomizeMyBird and Custom CSS For FX

This repository is for user submitted CSS customizations for:
1.  The very excellent Firefox and Thunderbird add-ons by Aris-t2 at https://github.com/Aris-t2 ; and
2.  Other useful CSS contributions for Firefox and Thunderbird.

Note:  I use the Classic Windows Theme on Win 7 as my starting point.  I prefer the older look of Windows over the Aero interface.  Then for Firefox I use the "Classic Blue" theme from ndnenigma  available for Firefox at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/5414873/ .  This theme is a dark theme for the toolbar and bookmarks menu toolbar and menu bar areas.  As a result various standard color choices from add-ons don't work as well as I would like.  Also, I like rounded tabs and spacing that is a little bit different from what the add-ons usually provide.

As a result I've had to modify some of the setup from Custom CSS For FX and CustomizeMyBird to get the look I find pleasing.

If you don't like the color choices in my CSS it can of course be easily modified.

Also, remember I am no programmer so let me apologize in advance if my CSS contains any deviations from best practices, etc.

If you want to further duplicate my color setup on Windws 7 then first select the Classic Windows Theme.  After that use the registry editor to add the JYLD_Color_Choices.reg file to your registry.
