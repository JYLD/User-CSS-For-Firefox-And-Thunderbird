User CSS Contributions For CustomizeMyBird and Custom CSS For FX

This repository is for user submitted CSS customizations for:
1.  The very excellent Firefox and Thunderbird add-ons by Aris-t2 at https://github.com/Aris-t2 ; and
2.  Other useful CSS contributions for Firefox and Thunderbird.

I use the Classic Blue theme available for Firefox available from Mozilla.  This theme is a dark theme for the toolbar and bookmarks menu toolbar and menu bar areas.  As a result various standard color themes from add-ons don't work as well as I like.  Also, I like rounded tabs and spacing that is a little bit different from what the standard looks usually provide.

As a result I've had to modify some of the setup from Custom CSS For FX and CustomizeMyBird to get the look I find pleasing.

If you don't like the color choices in my CSS it can of course be easily modified if you don't like my choices.

Also, remember I am no programmer so let me apologize in advance if my CSS contains any deviations from best practices, etc.
