User CSS Contributions For CustomizeMyBird and Custom CSS For FX

This repository is for user submitted CSS customizations for:
1.  The very excellent Firefox and Thunderbird add-ons by Aris-t2 at https://github.com/Aris-t2 ; and
2.  Other useful CSS contributions for Firefox and Thunderbird.

If you like Windows 7 or XP and you also like the Windows Classic XP/Win2000 look on Windows 7, then you may really like what the files here can do for you.

Note:  I prefer the older look of Windows XP/2000 over the Windows 7 Aero interface.  Therefore, I use the Classic Windows Theme on Win 7 as my starting point.  Then I add the "Classic Start Menu" available from http://www.classicshell.net/ .  Then for Firefox I use the "Classic Blue" theme from "ndnenigma" available for Firefox at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/5414873/ .  This theme is a dark theme for the toolbar, bookmarks toolbar, and menu bar areas.  For Thunderbird on my Windows 7 setup, I use the CustomizeMyBird and Theme and Font Size Changer add-ons.  Plus my own custom CSS placed in the CustomizeMyBird user CSS window.

Various standard color choices from add-ons don't work as well as I would like (colorwise) with my Windows Classic Theme setup.  Also, I like rounded tabs and spacing that is a little bit different from what the add-ons usually provide.

Therefore, I've had to modify some of the setup from Custom CSS For FX and CustomizeMyBird to get the look I find pleasing.

If you don't like the color choices in my CSS it can of course be easily modified.

Also, remember I am no programmer so let me apologize in advance if my CSS looks funny or something.

If you want to further duplicate my color setup on Windows 7 then first select the Classic Windows Theme.  After that download the JYLD_Color_Choices.zip file to your computer and then double click the reg files it contains to add it to your registry.  You should save a copy of your current theme before doing this so you can go back to your original color choices.  Also note that my color choices work on Windows 7 and XP.  On Windows 7 you must be using the Windows Classic Theme for these color choices to have any effect.  After adding the color choices reg file settings to your registry you will have to reboot your computer for the changes to take effect.  

NOTE:  I have no idea how the color choices reg files would affect Windows 8 to 10, if at all.  I don't even know if the Windows Classic Theme is available on Windows 8 to 10.
